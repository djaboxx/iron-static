### select_device

Parameter: `id NN`  
Selects the given device object in its track.   
You may obtain the id using a [live.path](</reference/live.path> "live.path") or by using `get devices` on a track, for example.   
The track containing the device will not be shown automatically, and the device gets the appointed device (blue hand) only if its track is selected.
